	<h4>Week 06/02/19 to 12/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	The first thing I did was set up my online blog on github. I had problems getting it to correctly host but in the end it worked.
	After the blog was setup I went back to the specification and properly read through it noting what was important right now and what was a concern for later.
	We had a group meeting after the first meeting with our project manager where we decided initial roles. 
	In the meeting I volunteered to organise our group repository according to the specification and anything else we all need.
	I had trouble initially with gitlab but after talking with people and looking through the quality assurance documents I managed to set up a group, create the directories and invite everyone.
	</p>
	<br>Hours spent this week (will be updated as more time is spent on activities):
	<ul><li>Creating my blog - 1</li>
	<li>The meeting after the tutorial - 1</li>
	<li>Reading through specification, guidelines and requirements - 2</li>
	<li>Going throught the repository and setting it up - 3</li>

	<h4>Week 13/02/19 to 19/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	The first thing this week was to go to the extra gitlab lecture which explained how it worked better and why it is used.
	This helped me restructure the project documentation according to the specification to allow for proper source control.
	The next part was with helping the UI on the android device behave like an android product.
	I specifically help with the quick navigation bar and the icons on it.
		On Monday we met as a group to look at the first UI design so everyone could make suggestions or question choices. We also talked about the gitlab system and how to use it.
	</p>
	<br>Hours spent this week (will be updated as more time is spent on activities):

	<h4>Week 20/02/19 to 26/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	This week I was tasked with SQLite to java connection spike testing. 
	In the end after a few small tests I concluded that it’s not difficult to use, but it will require investment to understand the systems.
	I found it to work even though the way it worked was sometimes convoluted.
	We also had a meeting about the final draft of the UI documentation and what to do next week.

	<h4>Week 27/02/19 to 5/03/19</h4>
	<p>
	During the meeting I was tasked with assessing how big our database could be, so I first looked at the sizes of datatypes. 
	Next, I considered how many of each we will need and then calculate upper and lower bounds and times it by mile stones of database sizes.
	Next came image constraints and so I looked at phone sizes for max resolution then file formats for storing it.

	<h4>Week 6/03/19 to 12/03/19</h4>
	<p>
	This week I spent time looking at the map program being prototyped by other group members.
	It was needed as certain computers were not treating well to it and they needed a third party to find out if it was a problem with the software or not.
	The next part was the looking at the design document and considering the first sections with a few group members.
	I was then assigned to try a first draft of the 3.1 section of the first draft. 
	</p>
	
	<br>Hours spent this week (will be updated as more time is spent on activities):
	<ul>
	<li>Map program verification - 2</li>
	<li>Design document discussion - 2.5</li>
	<li>Group meeting and discussion - 1.5</li>
	<li>Design document 3.1  - 2</li>

	<h4>Week 13/03/19 to 19/03/19</h4>
	<p>
	In this week’s meeting I was tasked with the sequence diagrams for the design document after my work on 3.1.
	I first had to read up on the details of sequence diagrams because I knew of them but didn’t understand conventions like why lines would be dotted. 
	Then came the mid-week meeting where I talked about progress and so was also given a quick extra little thing to look at some real Pubs and gather data on them.
	I then also was told to retouch 3.1 after things in the rest of the design document had changed.
	</p>
	
	<br>Hours spent this week (will be updated as more time is spent on activities):
	<ul>
	<li>Sequence Diagram for design document - 3</li>
	<li>Recording some Pub Data - 1</li>
	<li>Group meeting and discussion - 1.5</li>
	<li>3.1 changes - 1.5</li>

	<h4>Week 20/03/19 to 26/03/19</h4>
	<p>
	This week was a continuation of last week. I was tasked with cleaning up 3.1 and finishing 5.1 with the new edits people had made in mind.
	I found this not too hard but some aspects of the mobile architecture was confusing and I needed to ask people the minutia about the sections I was using for reference. 
	It was also decided to hold an extra Friday meeting for the people working on the design document which I attended.
	On Monday we had the weekly meeting to discuss progress and answer anymore questions that had come up over the weekend.
