	<h4>Week 06/02/19 to 12/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	The first thing I did was set up my online blog on github. I had problems getting it to correctly host but in the end it worked.
	After the blog was setup I went back to the specification and properly read through it noting what was important right now and what was a concern for later.
	We had a group meeting after the first meeting with our project manager where we decided initial roles. 
	In the meeting I volunteered to organise our group repository according to the specification and anything else we all need.
	I had trouble initially with gitlab but after talking with people and looking through the quality assurance documents I managed to set up a group, create the directories and invite everyone.

	<h4>Week 13/02/19 to 19/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	The first thing this week was to go to the extra gitlab lecture which explained how it worked better and why it is used.
	This helped me restructure the project documentation according to the specification to allow for proper source control.
	The next part was with helping the UI on the android device behave like an android product.
	I specifically help with the quick navigation bar and the icons on it.
		On Monday we met as a group to look at the first UI design so everyone could make suggestions or question choices. We also talked about the gitlab system and how to use it.

	<h4>Week 20/02/19 to 26/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	This week I was tasked with SQLite to java connection spike testing. 
	In the end after a few small tests I concluded that itâ€™s not difficult to use, but it will require investment to understand the systems.
	I found it to work even though the way it worked was sometimes convoluted.
	We also had a meeting about the final draft of the UI documentation and what to do next week.

	<h4>Week 27/02/19 to 5/03/19</h4>
	<p>
	During the meeting I was tasked with assessing how big our database could be, so I first looked at the sizes of datatypes. 
	Next, I considered how many of each we will need and then calculate upper and lower bounds and times it by mile stones of database sizes.
	Next came image constraints and so I looked at phone sizes for max resolution then file formats for storing it.
