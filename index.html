	<h4>04/02/19</h4>
	<p>
	The first thing I did was set up my online blog on github. I had problems getting it to correctly host but in the end it worked.
	After the blog was setup I went back to the specification and properly read through it noting what was important right now and what was a concern for later.
	We had a group meeting after the first meeting with our project manager where we decided initial roles. 
	In the meeting I volunteered to organise our group repository according to the specification and anything else we all need.
	I had trouble initially with gitlab but after talking with people and looking through the quality assurance documents I managed to set up a group, create the directories and invite everyone.
