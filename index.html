	<li>The first thing I did was set up my online blog on github. I had problems getting it to correctly host but in the end it worked.</li>
	<li>After the blog was setup I went back to the specification and properly read through it noting what was important right now and what was a concern for later.</li>
	<li>We had a group meeting after the first meeting with our project manager where we decided initial roles. In the meeting I volunteered to organise our group repository according to the specification and anything else we all need.</li>
	
	<br>Hours spent this week (will be updated as more time is spent on activities),
	<ul><li>Creating my blog - 1</li>
	<li>The meeting after the tutorial - 1</li>
	<li>Reading through specification, guidelines and requirements - 2</li>
	<li>Going throught the repository and setting it up - 4</li>
