	<h4>Week beginning 04/02/19,</h4>
	<p></p><ul><li>Set up my personal blog for the project. There were some issues with getting it to appear online, but I have since gotten it working.</li>
	<li>Read over the project specification and started thinking and considering what kind of tests would need to be run on the program. (what it should work and shouldnt work with)</li>
	<li>Reasarched into developing with Java for android and general GUI's with Java.</li></ul>
	I am continuing to look over the specification and come up with areas and things that will need to be tested to ensure the system is sufficently robust.
	<br>We have allocated preliminary roles to members of the group, but we currently (06/02/19) have planned to meet before our next tutorial to soldifiy who will have what positions.
	<br>Currently I have put my name forward for deputy project manager, I will update this blog on Firday (08/02/19) and will change this portion if needed.
	<br>For the next meeting/tutorial I intend to have a list of possible test areas, ideas for the basic graphical interface and questions to ask to our client (Chris Price).
	<br>I also will change or update/overhaul this blog to look more professional if the project workload eases/declines.

	<ul><li>Website - 1</li>
	<li>Meetings (outside of the tutorial) - 1</li>
